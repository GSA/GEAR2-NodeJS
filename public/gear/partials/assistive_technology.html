      </div>
      <div class="panel-body" style="margin : 20px">
        <p>For users of Assistive Technology, this page is intended to give you
          an overview of GEAR (the GSA Enterprise Analysis and Reporting site),
          in order to provide a frame of reference for further navigation. </p>
        <p>The front page consists of five navigation links (“Strategy,”
          “Business,” “Business Applications,” “Security,” and “Infrastructure”)
          that open up to list different reports (such as “GSA IT Strategic
          Framework” or “GSA Investments” under the “Strategy” navigation link).
          These navigation links are available on every one of the GEAR pages.
        </p>
        <p>There are also four information links (“Home,” “About,” “Contact EA
          Team,” and “Additional FEAF Resources”). Besides the “Home” link,
          these links take you to other pages that are formatted differently.
        </p>
        <p>The remainder of the front page consists of four dynamically created
          charts, depicting a count of business applications owned by an SSO, or
          investments in a particular category. The unlabelled images that your
          screen reader describes to you are either the pieces of the pie chart
          or color labels for the legend. There are no images of significance on
          the GEAR site. </p>
        <p>For every dynamic chart on the GEAR site, there is an accompanying
          list that contains the same information. For example, under the
          “Business” navigation link, there is a “GSA Capability Model” that
          visually depicts the same information that is available in the “GSA
          Capability List.” </p>
        <p>If you discover a component of the GEAR site that causes a problem
          with your assistive technology, please let us know at
          ea_planning@gsa.gov. We strive to make this site equally available to
          everyone. </p>
