If you’ve found yourself needing to learn more about the GSA organizational structure, there are two ways to access the org chart.


The first way is by clicking on the GSA Organization quadrant on the homepage. This activates an interactive organization chart for all of GSA.


Mousing over the SSO bubbles reveals an executive description of that SSO.  When each bubble is clicked the next level relationship is shown, down to the two letter organization.  


You’ll notice when the description window pops up, there is a small page icon next to the ‘x’ to close the window.  Clicking this icon takes you to an overview of the organization with 3 other tabs for that SSO’s Business, Applications, and Interfaces, if populated.


The second way to navigate this section is by clicking on the Business tab on the sidebar. Clicking here reveals four sub-categories; the last two are GSA Organization List and GSA Organization Chart.  The Organization List covers the org name, a description, and its parent org in report format.  The Organization Chart takes you to the bubble model as previously described.
