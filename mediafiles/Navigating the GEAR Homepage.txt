Purpose: Introduce GEAR’s homepage
Goal Duration/length: <230 words, <1.5 minutes


In this tutorial video, we are going to learn how to navigate the GEAR homepage. GEAR is short for GSA Enterprise Architecture Analytics & Reporting.


Along the top of the page, there are five links. Both the home and the GSA EA Analytics & Reporting links bring you back to the home page.


The Assistive Technology link describes the page for those using screen reading software.  


The About link provides a general overview of GEAR and other information, including an overview of Application Rationalization and information on GEAR’s data services.


Clicking the Contact EA Team link will open a new tab and start a draft email to the team who maintain GEAR. 


The Strategy, Business, Business Applications, Security, Technologies and Quick Video Tutorials buttons are interactive. Clicking them will reveal related sub categories.  


For example clicking on the Business Applications button will allow you to view the authoritative list of GSA Business Applications and the authoritative list of retired applications.


Each one of the quadrants on the homepage is interactive as well.


Within the GSA Business Applications quadrant, both the circular chart and the color coded SSO’s are clickable and will take you to a detailed listing of their applications.


The GSA Investment quadrant allows you to view detailed investment categories by clicking on the graph segments. These are the IT Investments that are reported to OMB.


Clicking on the GSA Capabilities or GSA Organization quadrant allows you to dive deeper into GSA capabilities and decompose the organization down to the two-letter office.
