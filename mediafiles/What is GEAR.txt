Purpose: Introduce GEAR and answer questions: what’s viewer’s problem, what is the solution, why are we the solution? Call to action.


Goal Duration/length: 1.5 minutes


Historically, Enterprise Architecture created complex diagrams more geared towards IT professionals, not considering the needs of the business.  


Without a trusted source to go to for information, IT and Business may find themselves unable to make informed decisions quickly. 


Here at GSA, we are changing how the organization uses Enterprise Architecture. Our new business-focused approach is about providing IT and business data to everyone at GSA, using GEAR.


Have you wondered where to go to learn more about GSA’s organization structure?


Or how IT supports GSA’s business?  


What software can be used at GSA? 


Or what an application is used for? 


GEAR, short for GSA Enterprise Architecture Analytics & Reporting, was developed with these questions in mind. 


Use Chrome for the best experience, go to ea.gsa.gov and explore the site!


You will be able to quickly learn about GSA. For example, you can click on the interactive GSA Organization chart icon to learn more about the organization structure.
